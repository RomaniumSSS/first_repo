# Meme Generator UI Redesign Prompt

I want you to condense the meme selection thing that is at the very top. I want you to put that instead in a left sidebar that goes vertical. If you're familiar with how Canva works, they have this kind of utility bar on the left. I kind of want that to be the case.

And then immediately to the right of that, I want this to be the canvas which is where the meme goes. And so here, once I select a meme in the left panel, it'll populate. And most of the screen should be this canvas that shows the meme.

And then I want you to put everything else in this little rounded rectangle bar at the bottom of the screen, centered. So that I can add things in like a little utility so it's not so jarring to have all these things on the screen.

And I think something like TL Draw has, or Excalibur has these little bars that you can select to do different things. I want you to take that philosophy.
